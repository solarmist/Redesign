	  Welcome to <strong class="savannah">wyldthingz</strong>, located 60
	  minutes north of San Francisco in our own &quot;wyld&quot; corner of
	  Wine Country. Here, we specialize in well rounded, TICA registered
	  Savannah Cats and Savannah Kittens since 2004. Our litters are
	  limited so that each kitten is treated as part of the family,
	  accustomed to children, other pets, and all the normal activities of
	  the home. This ensures that our savannah kittens are certain to
	  adjust well with any new situation and bond  easily with its new
	  family. Show, Breeding cats, and pets available occasionally. Quality
	  and not Quantity is our goal at Wyldthingz. I plan on focusing on
	  producing SILVER spotted savannahs  but we do have all colors and
	  often the destinctive black noses, like the serval. See our
	  <em class="savannah"><a href="kittens.html">kittens</a></em> for
	  current kittens available. I update photos often. For the privacy of
	  our cats and our family,  visiting is reserved for serious kitten
	  buyers only.

	    Fiji is a sizable F2 with almost perfect eye-hooding and long legs
	    with that warm gold background often sought after. A pair of huge
	    ears matches her excellent facial type. Fiji's kittens will be
	    eligible for showing and should be very impressive both in size,
	    type, and temperament. She is a fun-loving girl with a very regal
	    side to her. Her kittens also take on her sweet confindent manner.
	    She is one of my favorite moms.

	    As of 11-11 Fiji's brother, Trouble, owned by Debby of Savannah
	    Island is the Guiness Book of World Record's official "Tallest Cat"
	    reaching 19 inches at the shoulder!

	    It is no wonder Fiji makes such beautiful babies!
