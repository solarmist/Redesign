	  Welcome to <strong class="savannah">wyldthingz</strong>, located 60
	  minutes north of San Francisco in our own &quot;wyld&quot; corner of
	  Wine Country. Here, we specialize in well rounded, TICA registered
	  Savannah Cats and Savannah Kittens since 2004.
	<p>
	  Our litters are limited so that each kitten is treated as part of the
	  family, accustomed to children, other pets, and all the normal
	  activities of the home. This ensures that our savannah kittens are
	  certain to adjust well with any new situation and bond  easily with
	  its new family.
	<p>
	  Show, Breeding cats, and pets available occasionally. Quality
	  and not Quantity is our goal at Wyldthingz. I plan on focusing on
	  producing <strong class="savannah">SILVER</strong> spotted savannahs
	  but we do have all colors and often the destinctive black noses, like
	  the serval.
	<p>
	  See our <em class="savannah"><a href="kittens.html">kittens</a></em>
	  for current kittens available. I update photos often. For the privacy
	  of our cats and our family,  visiting is reserved for serious kitten
	  buyers only.

	    Ozo is a ebony silver F5C male from Allison Navarro of Jewels of
	    the Nile. Fingers are crossed that this silly, sweet young fellow
	    will eventually sire silver SBT kittens at Wyldthingz in the
	    future. Right now he still thinks he's a kitten. He has dark
	    spotting and well rounded ears that should compliment the
	    Wyldthingz girls well.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Shown at the TICA annual in 2010 with 9 other savannah in the ring,
	    he was well liked for his rich color, nice type, and great Savannah
	    Build. He took Best of Breed in one ring as the "Nicest silver I
	    have ever seen" by ring judge Karen McInchak. Thanks Karen! We are
	    proud of him!
