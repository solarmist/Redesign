	     Welcome to <strong class="savannah">wyldthingz</strong>, located 60 minutes north of San 
	     Francisco in our own &quot;wyld&quot; corner of Wine Country. Here, we 
	     specialize in well rounded, TICA registered Savannah Cats and Savannah Kittens
	     since 2004. Our litters are limited so that each kitten is treated as part
	     of the family, accustomed to children, other pets, and all the normal 
	     activities of the home. This ensures that our savannah kittens are certain to
	     adjust well with any new situation and bond  easily with its new family. Show,
	     Breeding cats, and pets available occasionally. Quality and not Quantity is 
	     our goal at Wyldthingz. I plan on focusing on producing SILVER spotted 
	     savannahs  but we do have all colors and often the destinctive black noses, 
	     like the serval. See our <em id="kittens"><a href="kittens.html">kittens</a></em> 
	     for current kittens available. I update photos often. For the privacy of our
	     cats and our family,  visiting is reserved for serious kitten buyers only.

	     The <strong class="savannah">Savannah</strong> cat was developed using crosses
	     with Bengal, Oriental shorthair, Egyptian Mau, and spotted Domestic shorthair 
	     cat with the African serval. The goal is to retain the lovely qualites of the 
	     serval, but in a smaller package. Savannah cats are not necessarly a HUGE cat. 
	     Some of my savannahs are large, however I make no promises for size. Savannahs
	     are intelligent, adventurous, play fetch, like water, and definately eye 
	     catching. In 2004, I fell in love with both the Savannah&#8217;s looks and 
	     confident nature. I found a cat that was a social as a dog and wouldn&#8217;t
	     be daunted by our active home. They are only wild &quot;looking&quot; but very
	     much house pets and should be kept indoors. We breed F3 through F6.
