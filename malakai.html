	  Welcome to <strong class="savannah">wyldthingz</strong>, located 60
	  minutes north of San Francisco in our own &quot;wyld&quot; corner of
	  Wine Country. Here, we specialize in well rounded, TICA registered
	  Savannah Cats and Savannah Kittens since 2004. Our litters are
	  limited so that each kitten is treated as part of the family,
	  accustomed to children, other pets, and all the normal activities of
	  the home. This ensures that our savannah kittens are certain to
	  adjust well with any new situation and bond  easily with its new
	  family. Show, Breeding cats, and pets available occasionally. Quality
	  and not Quantity is our goal at Wyldthingz. I plan on focusing on
	  producing SILVER spotted savannahs  but we do have all colors and
	  often the destinctive black noses, like the serval. See our
	  <em class="savannah"><a href="kittens.html">kittens</a></em> for
	  current kittens available. I update photos often. For the privacy of
	  our cats and our family,  visiting is reserved for serious kitten
	  buyers only.

	    "Malakai" is Magnetic indeed. He is all love to everyone who comes
	    through the door. His outgoing, confidence is accompanied by his
	    quality facial features, closely spaced ears and triangular face.
	    Sandy and Mike Hale are a credit to raising this fabulous creature
	    and I am proud to have him and show him in Advanced New Breed. He
	    was shown in 2008 at a few Northern California shows and at the
	    Savannah Rama in Lodi. He was well favored by the judges but his
	    hormones have begun to kick in and curtail his short show career.
	    He is now siring some fabulous C and SBT kittens which can be seen
	    on the kitten page from time to time.
