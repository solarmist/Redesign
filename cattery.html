	<h2>About the Cattery</h2>

	<p><strong>W</strong>yldthingz breeding Savannahs are carefully
	  selected for breed type, pedigree, temperament, color intensity, and
	  how each cross can better the breed.
	<p>
	  None of our breeding stock is purchased from large Savannah cat
	  "mills" but from small careful catteries with the same integrity of
	  values and purpose in mind for the savannah cat.
	<p>
	  We strive toward health and show standard with an aim to develop the
	  best quality companion or show prospect.
	<p>
	  Our kittens are raised inside our home and handled daily, played with
	  and exposed to dogs and children. On the other hand, the kittens are
	  not allowed to have free run of the house until they show to have
	  good litter box habits. Wyldthingz savannah kittens should come to
	  you well adjusted, playful, and eager for attention, with excellent
	  litter habits.
	<p>
	  Our breeding males are kept in the house as kittens until they are
	  around breeding age (and consequently marking their territory). At
	  that point, they have roomy outdoor cages with warm fuzzy beds,
	  hammocks, and toys.

	<p>

	  Wyldthingz cats have an added advantage of having a large outdoor
	  enclosure. Some of the girls get free run of the house and enclosure
	  shared with the dogs and Chilly, my daughter's Siberian cat. The boys
	  are allowed time outside their pens for at least a hour to stretch
	  their legs and just be a cat. Our cats can watch birds in the trees,
	  the jackrabbits in the meadow beyond, chase bugs and butterflies, or
	  practice stalking through the grass like their wild serval heritage -
	  in safety.
	<p>

	  The cats get to eat a high quality diet which includes, a premium
	  quality grain-free dry food, ground raw chicken, canned food and
	  whole prey.
	<p>
	  They have as normal a pet life as possible and are treated as part of
	  the family.
