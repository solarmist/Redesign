	    Ozo is a ebony silver F5C male from Allison Navarro of Jewels of the 
	    Nile. Fingers are crossed that this silly, sweet young fellow will 
	    eventually sire silver SBT kittens at Wyldthingz in the future. Right now
	    he still thinks he's a kitten. He has dark spotting and well rounded ears
	    that should compliment the Wyldthingz girls well.
	    <br><br>
	    Shown at the TICA annual in 2010 with 9 other savannah in the ring, he 
	    was well liked for his rich color, nice type, and great Savannah Build.
	    He took Best of Breed in one ring as the &quot;Nicest silver I have ever
	    seen&quot; by ring judge Karen McInchak. Thanks Karen! We are proud of 
	    him!
